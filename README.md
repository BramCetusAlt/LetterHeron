This is a simple tool that can encrypt text using Caesar's cipher and Base64. It can also be used to count how many times a character appears in a text. Something that could be useful in decryption.

# How to use the Caesar's Cipher tool:
Just enter the text you wish to encrypt or decrypt along with a number from 0 to 25. That number is the key used to encrypt/decrypt the text.

# How to use the Base64 tool:
You only need to enter a text and choose whether you wish to encrypt or decrypt it.

# How to use the Character count tool:
Enter your text and then enter the character you wish to count.

# Note:
You cannot use spaces but you can use underscores or other characters instead.
